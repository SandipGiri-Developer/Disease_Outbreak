# Disease Outbreak Prediction System 🏥

## 📌 Overview
The **Disease Outbreak Prediction System** is a Machine Learning-powered web application designed to predict the likelihood of three major diseases: **Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease**. The system enables users to assess potential health risks by inputting relevant medical parameters. It employs pre-trained ML models and is built using **Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Predicts risk levels** for:
  - **Diabetes**: Based on features like pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
  - **Heart Disease**: Uses parameters such as cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.
  - **Parkinson's Disease**: Evaluates voice-related parameters like jitter, shimmer, frequency, and amplitude variations.
- **Intuitive user interface** powered by Streamlit.
- **Seamless navigation** through different prediction sections.
- **Fast and accurate results** using pre-trained ML models.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `streamlit` → For the web-based UI
  - `pickle` → For loading pre-trained ML models
  - `streamlit_option_menu` → For sidebar navigation
